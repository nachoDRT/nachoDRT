## Hi there! 👋

### About me 👨‍💻
I am Nacho de Rodrigo, a PhD student at the [Institute for Research in Engineering](https://www.iit.comillas.edu/index.php.en). My PhD topic is synthetic image generation, which involves generating images in controlled environments to obtain multimodal datasets. With these datasets, I can train Deep Learning Models and solve problems where data is scarce, detect biases in Large Language Models, or provide deeper explainability for AI.

Here you can find an example from my last research project: [the MERIT-Dataset](https://github.com/nachoDRT/MERIT-Dataset)

### Teaching/Supervising 👨‍🏫
I am an active member at [Comillas-ICAI University](https://www.comillas.edu/en/icai/), working with undergrad students on different topics:

+ **📚 I teach laboratory sessions on Introduction to Computer Vision**. You can find some of my student's projects here:
  + A basketball points counter: [PI-Basketball](https://github.com/miguel-ara/RaspberryPI_Basketball_CV)
  + A human-computer pattern communication: [Wandavision](https://github.com/winoo19/wandavision)
+ **👀 I supervise scholarships and bachelor/master's theses**. You can find some of the projects I have supervised here:
  + A dataset and fine-tuned LLM to summarize phone calls: [Call-Sum](https://github.com/CICLAB-Comillas/CallSum)
  + A tangible user interface to simulate mobility flows in cities: [Bord](https://github.com/iit-asi/board)
  + A plug-and-play Augmented Reality library for Python: [Armor](https://github.com/The-Hidden-Gallery/ARMOR)
